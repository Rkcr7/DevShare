## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- A Telegram account and the Telegram app on your phone
- Internet connection on both your phone and PC

## üîë Getting Started

Before installing DevShare, you'll need your Telegram ID to authenticate with the service:

1. Open Telegram on your phone or desktop
2. Search for the bot named **@userinfobot**
3. Start a chat and send any message
4. The bot will reply with your Telegram User ID (a number like `123456789`)
5. Note this number as you'll need it during setup

Once installed, you'll use the official DevShare bot:
- Search for **@Screenshot_rk7_bot** in Telegram
- Or visit directly: [t.me/Screenshot_rk7_bot](https://t.me/Screenshot_rk7_bot)
- Only your authorized device will receive the screenshots you send to this bot

## üîß Installation

### Windows
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Rkcr7/DevShare.git
cd DevShare

# 2. Run the setup script
setup.bat

# 3. Launch the application
run_devshare.bat
```

### Linux/macOS
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Rkcr7/DevShare.git
cd DevShare

# 2. Make scripts executable
chmod +x setup.sh run_devshare.sh

# 3. Run the setup script
./setup.sh

# 4. Launch the application
./run_devshare.sh
```

### Manual Installation
If the setup scripts don't work for you:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Linux users: Install clipboard utility
sudo apt-get install xclip   # Debian/Ubuntu
# or
sudo dnf install xclip       # Fedora

# Run the application
python main.py
```

If the setup wizard doesn't appear or you need to manually configure the application:

1. Create a `config.json` file in the root directory with the following structure:
```json
{
  "telegram_id": "YOUR_TELEGRAM_ID",
  "service_url": "https://devshare-production.up.railway.app"
}
```

2. Replace `YOUR_TELEGRAM_ID` with your actual Telegram ID (numeric value)
   - To find your ID, message @userinfobot on Telegram

3. The `service_url` is pre-configured to the cloud server - typically you won't need to change this value

4. After creating the file, run the application using `python main.py`

## üì± Usage

1. Start the application using the appropriate launcher for your platform
2. Open Telegram on your phone and search for **@Screenshot_rk7_bot** 
   - Or visit directly: [t.me/Screenshot_rk7_bot](https://t.me/Screenshot_rk7_bot)
3. Send `/start` to initialize the bot
4. Take a screenshot on your phone and send it to the bot
5. The screenshot will be automatically copied to your PC's clipboard - just paste anywhere!
6. Use the application interface to browse, search, and manage your screenshot history

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **Bot Doesn't Respond**: Ensure your internet connection is active and the application is running
- **Clipboard Issues**: 
  - Windows: Verify pywin32 is installed (`pip install pywin32`)
  - Linux: Ensure xclip is installed (`sudo apt-get install xclip`)
  - macOS: No additional setup needed
- **UI Issues**: Make sure customtkinter is installed correctly (`pip install customtkinter==5.2.0`)
- **Connection Problems**: Verify your internet connection and that the service is available
